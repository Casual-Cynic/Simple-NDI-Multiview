# Simple NDI Multiview

A free and open source multiviewer built with Unity and uses keijiro's [KlakNDI](https://github.com/keijiro/KlakNDI) integration.

### Current Functionality
+ automatically tiling of as many sources as your PC can handle
thats pretty much it. At least for now.

This was a pretty quick and dirty project that I threw together in the total time of an afternoon or 2. so because of that it's missing a lot of "creature comforts" *(aka stuff that should already exist in this kind of tool)*, so below is a list of features that im working on getting up and running in future releases.

### Upcoming Functionality

+ Customizeable background/splash image
+ More logical source management. a way to place the NDI sources where you want them. Drag and drop hopefully
+ The abiity to output the multiview as NDI itself. Hopefully allowing for nesting NDI sources
+ General UI clean up. make it a bit more presentable.
